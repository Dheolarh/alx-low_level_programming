This project provides a set of learning objectives and requirements for a programming task. The project focuses on developing specific skills and knowledge in the following areas:

**Learning Objectives:**

1. **General:** Develop the ability to find the right source of information independently.
2. **Bit Manipulation:** Gain proficiency in manipulating bits and using bitwise operators.
3. **Copyright and Plagiarism:** Understand the importance of original work and avoiding plagiarism.

**Requirements:**

**General:**
- Specific code editors (vi, vim, emacs) are allowed for coding.
- All code files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with specified options.
- Code files should end with a newline.
- A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory for documentation.
- Code should follow the Betty style, checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
- No use of global variables is allowed.
- A maximum of 5 functions are allowed per code file.
- Only specific C standard library functions are permitted (e.g., malloc, free, exit), and the use of other functions (e.g., printf, puts) is forbidden.
- The use of a custom `_putchar` function is allowed.
- _putchar.c should not be pushed; a provided version will be used.
- Function prototypes, including `_putchar`, must be included in a header file named main.h.
- The header file should be included with your code.
- Header files should be include guarded to prevent multiple inclusions.

The project emphasizes the importance of learning how to find information, understanding bitwise operations, and strictly adhering to coding standards and plagiarism guidelines. It also provides specific technical requirements for the coding task, including using certain editors, compiler options, and coding style.
